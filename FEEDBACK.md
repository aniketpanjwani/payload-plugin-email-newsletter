# Feedback & Design Decisions

We'd love your feedback on the Payload Newsletter Plugin! This document outlines key design decisions we've made and areas where community input would be especially valuable.

## ü§î Design Decisions We'd Like Feedback On

### 1. Magic Link Authentication Approach

**Current Design**: We've implemented a custom JWT-based magic link system that's completely separate from Payload's built-in authentication.

**Rationale**: 
- Newsletter subscribers typically don't need full CMS access
- Passwordless is more user-friendly for newsletter management
- Keeps subscriber auth separate from admin auth

**Questions for the Community**:
- Would you prefer an option to integrate with Payload's auth system?
- Is the current token expiration (7 days) appropriate?
- Should we support other passwordless methods (OTP, social login)?

### 2. Email Provider Architecture

**Current Design**: We support Resend and Broadcast with a provider-agnostic interface.

**Questions for the Community**:
- Which other email providers should we prioritize? (SendGrid, Mailgun, AWS SES, Postmark?)
- Should we support multiple providers simultaneously (e.g., failover)?
- Is the current provider interface flexible enough for your needs?

### 3. Newsletter Scheduling Integration

**Current Design**: We inject fields into your existing articles collection rather than creating a separate newsletter collection.

**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing content
- Avoids duplication
- Simpler mental model

**Questions for the Community**:
- Would you prefer a dedicated newsletters collection?
- Should we support scheduling multiple article types (not just articles)?
- What additional scheduling features would be valuable?

### 4. Component Library Approach

**Current Design**: React-only components using Payload's UI library.

**Questions for the Community**:
- Would you like vanilla JS examples for non-React frontends?
- Should we provide more component variants (embedded, modal, etc.)?
- What styling/theming options would be most useful?

### 5. Data Collection & Analytics

**Current Design**: We collect UTM parameters and basic metadata but don't include analytics dashboards.

**Questions for the Community**:
- What analytics would be most valuable to track?
- Should we integrate with analytics platforms (GA, Plausible, etc.)?
- Would you want a built-in analytics dashboard?

### 6. Default Field Schema

**Current Design**: We include a comprehensive set of fields (name, locale, preferences, segments, etc.).

**Questions for the Community**:
- Are there fields we should add or remove by default?
- Should some fields be opt-in rather than default?
- How can we better support custom field requirements?

## üí° Feature Requests

We're considering these features for future releases:

1. **Double opt-in workflow** - Email confirmation before activation
2. **A/B testing** - Test subject lines and content
3. **Automation workflows** - Welcome series, drip campaigns
4. **Segmentation UI** - Visual segment builder
5. **Template marketplace** - Share email templates
6. **Import/Export tools** - Migrate from other platforms
7. **Webhook support** - Notify external services of events
8. **Email preview** - See how emails look before sending

**What features would you prioritize?**

## üêõ Known Limitations

Current limitations we're aware of:

1. No built-in unsubscribe page (API only)
2. No email bounce handling
3. No GDPR compliance features (by design, but reconsidering)
4. Limited email template customization
5. No support for attachments

**Which limitations affect you most?**
