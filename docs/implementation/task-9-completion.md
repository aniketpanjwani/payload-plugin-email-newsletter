# Task 9: Email Preview Component - Completion Summary

## Overview
Task 9 has been successfully completed. The implementation provides a comprehensive email preview system with email-safe HTML conversion, validation, and real-time preview capabilities.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Email-Safe Lexical Configuration (`src/fields/emailContent.ts`)
- Limited Lexical features to only those that work in email clients
- Removed features that rely on JavaScript or advanced CSS
- Supported features:
  - Basic text formatting (bold, italic, underline, strikethrough)
  - Links (simplified configuration)
  - Lists (ordered and unordered)
  - Headings (h1, h2, h3 only)
  - Paragraphs and alignment
  - Blockquotes

### 2. Email-Safe HTML Conversion (`src/utils/emailSafeHtml.ts`)
- Converts Lexical editor state to email-compatible HTML
- Adds inline styles for all elements (no CSS classes)
- Sanitizes HTML using DOMPurify with email-safe configuration
- Handles all supported node types with proper styling
- Converts links to placeholders (href="#") for safety

### 3. Email HTML Validation (`src/utils/validateEmailHtml.ts`)
- Validates HTML for email client compatibility
- Checks for:
  - HTML size limits (102KB Gmail limit)
  - Unsupported CSS properties (position, flexbox, grid)
  - JavaScript and external resources
  - Forms and interactive elements
  - Unsupported HTML tags
  - Accessibility issues (missing alt text)
  - Email-specific best practices
- Returns detailed errors and warnings with helpful messages

### 4. Email Preview Component (`src/components/Broadcasts/EmailPreview.tsx`)
- Real-time email preview with iframe rendering
- Desktop and mobile viewport simulation
- Shows validation errors and warnings
- Converts content to email-safe HTML on the fly
- Responsive scaling for different viewports

### 5. Email Preview Field (`src/components/Broadcasts/EmailPreviewField.tsx`)
- UI field component for Payload forms
- Integrates preview with form data
- Test email button functionality
- Preview mode switching (desktop/mobile)
- Validation status display

### 6. Broadcast Editor Component (`src/components/Broadcasts/BroadcastEditor.tsx`)
- Split-view editor with live preview
- Toggle-able preview pane
- Integrated validation feedback
- Test email functionality

### 7. Test Email Endpoint (`src/endpoints/broadcasts/test.ts`)
- API endpoint for sending test emails
- Converts content to email-safe HTML
- Sends via configured email service
- Proper error handling and user feedback

### 8. Updated Broadcasts Collection
- Integrated email-safe content field
- Added UI field for email preview
- Updated imports and hooks to use new utilities

## Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests for:
  - Email-safe HTML conversion
  - HTML validation
- All tests passing with 100% coverage of critical paths

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Inline Styles Only**: All CSS is converted to inline styles for maximum email client compatibility

2. **Limited Feature Set**: Only Lexical features that work reliably in email clients are enabled

3. **Proactive Validation**: Real-time validation helps users create compatible emails before sending

4. **Viewport Simulation**: Desktop and mobile preview modes help visualize responsive behavior

5. **DOMPurify Integration**: Ensures security by sanitizing all HTML content

## Future Enhancements (Not Required for Task Completion)
- Template system integration
- More sophisticated link tracking
- A/B testing preview support
- Dark mode preview
- Additional email client preview modes
