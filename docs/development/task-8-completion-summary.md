# Task 8: Send/Schedule Modal - Completion Summary

## What Was Implemented

Task 8 has been successfully completed. We've created a comprehensive modal system for sending and scheduling broadcasts with the following features:

### 1. SendBroadcastModal Component
- **Location**: `src/components/Broadcasts/SendBroadcastModal.tsx`
- **Features**:
  - Send now or schedule for later options
  - Provider capability detection (scheduling only shown for Broadcast API)
  - Date/time picker with validation
  - Audience selection UI (ready for API integration)
  - Summary display before sending
  - Error handling and loading states

### 2. Integration with ActionsCell
- **Updated**: `src/components/Broadcasts/ActionsCell.tsx`
- Both Send and Schedule buttons now open the modal
- Modal handles both immediate send and scheduling
- Success actions trigger page reload to update status

### 3. Modal Features

#### Send Options
- **Send Now**: Immediately sends the broadcast
- **Schedule**: Sets a future date/time (only for Broadcast provider)

#### Audience Selection
- UI displays mock audiences (All Subscribers, Active Subscribers)
- Checkbox selection with subscriber counts
- Ready for integration when audience endpoints are implemented

#### Validation
- Ensures broadcast is synced with provider
- Validates scheduled time is in the future
- Shows clear error messages

#### User Experience
- Clean, centered modal design
- Loading states during API calls
- Success messages with alerts (can be upgraded to toasts)
- Summary section shows all details before sending

## API Integration

The modal integrates with existing endpoints:
- `POST /api/broadcasts/:id/send` - For immediate sending
- `POST /api/broadcasts/:id/schedule` - For scheduled sending

Both endpoints support optional `audienceIds` parameter for targeting.

## Next Steps

With Task 8 complete, the next task is **Task 9: Email Preview Component**, which will:
1. Create email-safe Lexical configuration
2. Build HTML converter with sanitization
3. Create split-view editor
4. Add preview modes (desktop/mobile)
5. Implement test send functionality
