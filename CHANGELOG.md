  - Moved broadcast endpoints from global endpoints to collection endpoints
  - Endpoints are now properly registered on the broadcasts collection
  - Fixes 404 errors for all broadcast endpoints (/preview, /test, /send, /schedule)
  - Aligns with Payload v3 architecture where collection endpoints should be defined on the collection

### Changed

## [0.16.10] - 2025-01-29

### Fixed

### Fixed
- **Deferred Provider Sync for Empty Broadcasts** - Fixed issue where broadcasts created empty were never synced to provider
  - Update operation now handles "deferred create" scenario when providerId is missing
  - When a broadcast has subject and content but no providerId, it creates the broadcast in the provider
  - Normal update sync works for broadcasts that already exist in the provider
  - Resolves workflow: create empty → add content → save → now syncs to provider

### Technical
- Modified update operation handler to check for missing providerId
- Added deferred create logic in update afterChange hook
- Separated normal update logic to only run when providerId exists
- Added comprehensive error handling for both deferred create and normal update scenarios

  - Broadcasts can now be created empty and synced later when content is added

### Technical
- Updated convertToEmailSafeHtml to accept undefined/null editorState
- Added pre-sync validation in afterChange hook for create operations
- Empty broadcasts are saved in Payload but not synced to provider until content is added

## [0.16.7] - 2025-07-29

### Added
- **Comprehensive Diagnostic Logging** - Added extensive logging to diagnose broadcast sync issues
  - Logs the HTML content conversion process
  - Shows exactly what data is being sent to the Broadcast API (with preview)
  - Displays request URL, method, and body structure

- Logs help identify if issues are with content, API format, or authentication

## [0.16.6] - 2025-07-29

### Fixed
- **Critical: Update Sync Now Works** - Fixed the afterChange hook that was blocking update operations
  - Removed the `operation !== 'create'` check that prevented the afterChange hook from running on updates
  - Moved update sync logic from beforeChange to afterChange for proper architectural pattern
  - Updates are now synced AFTER they're saved to Payload, ensuring consistency
  - Provider sync failures no longer block Payload updates

### Improved
- **Better Hook Architecture** - Sync operations now happen in the correct lifecycle stage
  - beforeChange was architecturally wrong - if provider sync failed, data would be inconsistent
  - afterChange ensures Payload data is saved first, then syncs to provider
  - More resilient to network failures and API errors

### Technical
- Consolidated create and update logic in a single afterChange hook
- Added comprehensive content change detection before syncing
- Enhanced logging for update sync operations
- Removed redundant beforeChange hook logic

## [0.16.5] - 2025-07-29

### Breaking Changes

  - This avoids confusion with Payload's built-in `_status` field (draft/published)
  - Database field is now `sendStatus` for email send status (draft, scheduled, sending, sent, etc.)
  - All references in providers, endpoints, and types have been updated
  - If you have existing broadcast data with a `status` field, you'll need to migrate it to `sendStatus`

### Fixed
- **Update Sync** - Fixed issue where broadcast updates made in Payload weren't syncing to the Broadcast provider
  - The update hook now correctly checks `sendStatus` instead of the non-existent `status` field
  - Provider can now properly determine if a broadcast is editable based on its send status

### Technical

  - Shows what fields are being synced to the provider
  - Helps diagnose why updates might not be syncing
  - Added info logging for skipped updates due to status restrictions
- **Clearer Field Naming** - Renamed `status` field to `sendStatus` to avoid confusion with Payload's `_status`
  - Database field is now `sendStatus` (draft, scheduled, sending, sent, etc.)
  - Payload's versioning field remains `_status` (draft, published)
  - Added virtual `status` field for API backward compatibility
  - Makes it clear which status controls email sending vs content publishing

## [0.16.3] - 2025-07-27

### Improved
- **Enhanced Error Logging** - Improved error logging for broadcast operations
  - Now logs full error details including message, stack trace, and any additional error properties
  - Helps diagnose API connection issues, authentication failures, and validation errors

  - Applied to all broadcast hooks: create, update, delete, and send

## [0.16.2] - 2025-07-27

### Fixed
- **Configuration Consistency** - Fixed broadcast operations to read from Newsletter Settings collection
  - Broadcast create/update/delete operations now check Newsletter Settings first before falling back to env vars
  - This matches the behavior of email operations (magic links, welcome emails)
  - Resolves issue where broadcasts failed when env vars were missing despite settings being configured
  - Added `getBroadcastConfig` utility for consistent configuration retrieval

### Added
- **Configuration Utilities** - New utilities for consistent provider configuration
  - `getBroadcastConfig` - Gets Broadcast provider config from settings or env vars

  - Both utilities handle errors gracefully with fallback to env vars

## [0.16.1] - 2025-07-27

### Fixed
- **Critical Bug Fix** - Fixed afterChange hook placement for sending broadcasts
  - The send hook was incorrectly placed in the `afterDelete` array instead of `afterChange`
  - This prevented broadcasts from being sent when published
  - Publishing broadcasts now correctly triggers the send functionality

## [0.16.0] - 2025-07-27

- **Jobs Queue Documentation** - Added comprehensive setup instructions for scheduled publishing
  - Vercel Cron configuration example
  - Security setup with CRON_SECRET
  - Step-by-step guide for enabling scheduled broadcasts

### Removed
- **Custom UI Components** (Breaking Change)
  - `SendBroadcastModal` - Custom send/schedule modal
  - `ActionsCell` - Custom action buttons in list view
  - `actions` field from Broadcasts collection
  - These are replaced by Payload's native publish/schedule functionality

### Technical
- Enabled `versions` configuration on Broadcasts collection with drafts and scheduled publishing
- Updated default columns to show both `_status` (Draft/Published) and `status` (send status)
- Improved TypeScript exports by removing deleted component references
- All tests passing with minor version upgrade

### Migration Guide
If you were using the custom Send/Schedule modal:
1. The functionality is now built into Payload's publish system
2. To send immediately: Click "Publish"
3. To schedule: Click "Schedule" (requires Jobs Queue setup)
4. Remove any imports of `SendBroadcastModal` or `ActionsCell` from your code

## [0.5.0] - 2025-06-20

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Changed newsletter settings from a collection back to a global configuration
  - Settings are now accessed as a single global config instead of multiple documents
  - Removed the "name" and "active" fields as they're no longer needed for globals
  - Settings now appear as a single page in the admin UI instead of a list view
  - Updated all code to use `payload.findGlobal()` instead of `payload.find()`
  
### Migration Required
- Users with existing newsletter-settings collections will need to manually copy their active configuration to the new global settings
- After migration, the old newsletter-settings collection can be removed from the database
