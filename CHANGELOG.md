## [0.5.0] - 2025-06-20

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Changed newsletter settings from a collection back to a global configuration
  - Settings are now accessed as a single global config instead of multiple documents
  - Removed the "name" and "active" fields as they're no longer needed for globals
  - Settings now appear as a single page in the admin UI instead of a list view
  - Updated all code to use `payload.findGlobal()` instead of `payload.find()`
  
### Migration Required
- Users with existing newsletter-settings collections will need to manually copy their active configuration to the new global settings
- After migration, the old newsletter-settings collection can be removed from the database

### Fixed
- Resolved user confusion around having multiple settings documents when only one could be active
- Settings now follow the standard Payload pattern for configuration globals
