/**
 * IMPLEMENTATION NOTES:
 * 
 * 1. Most methods throw NOT_SUPPORTED errors because Resend's Broadcast API
 *    is not publicly documented
 * 
 * 2. The SDK might have undocumented methods (broadcasts.create, broadcasts.send, etc.)
 *    that we attempt to use, but we can't guarantee they exist
 * 
 * 3. Important limitation: Broadcasts created via API can only be edited via API,
 *    not in the Resend dashboard
 * 
 * 4. Resend uses "Audiences" instead of "Segments" for targeting
 * 
 * 5. Analytics are available in the dashboard but API access is unclear
 * 
 * FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS:
 * - Monitor Resend's documentation for Broadcast API updates
 * - Explore SDK source code for undocumented methods
 * - Consider using Resend's email API to simulate broadcasts
 * - Add webhook support for delivery/open/click tracking
