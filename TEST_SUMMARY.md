```

## Notes

Some integration tests are failing because they were written against expected implementations that differ from the actual endpoint implementations. The core security patterns and unit tests are all passing and provide good coverage of the security improvements made in versions 0.3.0 and 0.3.1.

The test infrastructure is flexible and can be easily extended as the plugin evolves. The behavior-based mocks allow for realistic testing of email provider interactions, and the Payload mock provides a good simulation of the CMS behavior for testing access control patterns.
